# Fraudulent Detection

The Fraud Detection App aims to automate this process by leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify potential anomalies indicative of fraud.

# Features:
* Anomaly Detection: Using the Isolation Forest algorithm, the app analyzes the dataset to detect potential fraudulent transactions. 

* Visualization: The app provides visualizations of the detected anomalies, making it easier for users to interpret and understand the results.

# How It Works:

* Upon loading the transaction data, the Fraud Detection App pre-processes the data, selects relevant features, and applies the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies.
* Detected anomalies are then visualized on a scatter plot, distinguishing between non-fraudulent and potentially fraudulent transactions.
